    "# Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning with QLoRA\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is a technique that optimizes a subset of a large model's parameters instead of updating the entire model during fine-tuning. This approach is especially beneficial for large language models like GPT & LLaMA, where updating all parameters would be computationally expensive and memory-intensive. \n",
    "\n",
    "LoRA : LoRA is a technique that enables efficient fine-tuning of large language models by adding small, trainable low-rank matrices to the model. Instead of updating all parameters, LoRA only adapts a subset of parameters, allowing the model to focus on capturing task-specific variations without requiring a full update of the entire model.\n",
    "\n",
    "QLoRA : QLoRA builds on LoRA by adding quantization, making it even more memory-efficient. In QLoRA, the main model weights are quantized to a 4-bit precision format. This reduces the memory needed to store and process the model’s parameters. "

    "This lab explores Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) using QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation) to fine-tune the NousResearch/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf model on the mlabonne/guanaco-llama2-1k dataset. The lab walks through configuring QLoRA parameters, bitsandbytes quantization settings, TrainingArguments, and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) parameters. Participants will implement QLoRA to efficiently adapt a large-scale model while reducing memory footprint and computational costs."

During training, dropout randomly \"drops out\" (or deactivates) a fraction of neurons in a layer by setting their output to zero. This prevents the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron or specific set of neurons to make predictions.\n"
